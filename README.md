这个项目包含了供应链竞赛的题目和求解代码。我们将一个物流分包运输问题转化为了流约束的整数规划模型，该模型可以将全国范围内的物流规划问题在秒级别求解到最优”

This project encompasses a set of problems related to supply chain competitions, along with their solution codes. We have transformed a logistics subcontracting transportation issue into a flow-constrained integer programming model. This model is capable of solving nationwide logistics planning problems to optimality within seconds.
